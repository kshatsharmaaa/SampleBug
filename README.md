# Sample Bug

**Sample Bug** is a Next.js project where I replicated various components of an existing website for **learning purposes**. This project helped me practice React, Next.js features, and component-based architecture by building and experimenting with reusable UI components.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This project is for learning and practice only. It is **not an official copy** of any website.
